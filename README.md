# CyberShop
Cybershop is a cyberpunk-themed fictitious business management app from 2079. 
Its purpose is to sell cybernetic prostheses to be viewed in the app through augmented reality or in 3D
in the form of an STL file, a format of CAD, which once purchased can be printed at home using your own
3D printer enabled for printing biocompatible electronic implants and circuits.

### The app allows:  
User registration and authentication.  
Access to a home with the products in the store.  
The ability to add a product to the user's wishlist
and/or review it giving from 1 to 5 stars.  
Access to the authenticated user profile to view your wishlist.  
Access to a dashboard for the administrator who can add,  
edit and delete a product directly from the app,  
viewing your data and basic statistics of the store.  

## Databases:
You need the following FireBase services(or equivalent idk):

<b>Authentication:</b> to manage email, user UID and authentication.  
<b>Realtime Database:</b> list of products, users and wishlist.  
<b>Storage:</b> where the image and STL of the product are saved
